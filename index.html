    <p>Hello, my name is Bushra, and I'm 21 years old. I am currently studying Computer Systems Engineering at the Arab American University, in my third year of studies. I have a strong interest in broadening my knowledge across various fields. I enjoy exploring new things, trying different cuisines, and volunteering. Developing my personality and striving to lead a successful life as a Muslim are important goals for me :)</p>

    <p>Jenin, town in the West Bank. Originally administered as part of the British mandate of Palestine (1920–48), Jenin was in the area annexed by Jordan in 1950 following the first of the Arab-Israeli wars (1948–49). After the Six-Day War of 1967, it was part of the West Bank territory under Israeli occupation until coming under the administration of the Palestinian Authority in the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords.</p>
